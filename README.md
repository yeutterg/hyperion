# Hyperion Fork for MacOS

This is a fork of [Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion), an open-source clone of [Ambilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambilight), for MacOS. 

## Overview

At the time of forking, the [compile instructions]() on the main project did not work on MacOS High Sierra (v10.13).

The changes are inspired by those made by [Danimal4326](https://github.com/Danimal4326/hyperion/commit/d1ee432ba3e48749900cf0083278dbe1e65891ee#diff-975b84a0bb29583e8983da66c1373744R75) but forked from a newer version of the software.

The source is released under MIT-License (see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Installation

To build on MacOS, follow the instructions in the file [Install_Hyperion_MacOS](./Install_Hyperion_MacOS.md).

Please raise an issue if you encounter one. I cannot guarantee, however, that I will be able to fix it.
