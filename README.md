# Hyperion Fork for MacOS

This is a fork of [Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion), an open-source 'Ambilight' implementation, for MacOS. 

At the time of forking, the compile instructions on the main project did not work on MacOS High Sierra (v10.13).

The changes are inspired by those made by [Danimal4326](https://github.com/Danimal4326/hyperion/commit/d1ee432ba3e48749900cf0083278dbe1e65891ee#diff-975b84a0bb29583e8983da66c1373744R75) but from a newer fork.

To build on MacOS, follow the instructions in the file [Install_Hyperion_MacOS](./Install_Hyperion_MacOS.md).
